# Adding Images

## Submission

Either create a pull request into `main` or send your photo with the location marked clearly to an ISMA-IDET member. If the photo is historical (i.e. over one years old), specify the most accurate date. If the photo was not taken by you, specify the author and source.

## Format

All submissions should be in WebP format (ideally >90% lossy or lossless), under around 15MB. High quality is recommended: do not submit blurry or unclear photos. Submit the photo as it was taken without unnecessary modifications, excluding censorship or raw processing.

## Other Notes

* Your photo cannot include any current students. Material that includes a crowd, has been previously available to the public, or falls under the "historical" category is allowed. If your photo includes any people, properly blur or cover their faces.
* Your photo cannot include personal or sensitive information.
* Do not submit photos taken outside ISMA campus or inside residential hall wings.
* By submitting your photo, you agree to share its ownership with ISMA-IDET. This grants ISMA-IDET rights to modify and distribute without attribution, including non-commercial and commercial use. Any future licenses applied to this repository will also apply to the photos.
